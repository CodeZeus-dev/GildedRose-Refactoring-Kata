# Gilded Rose Tech Test

In this project, the aim is to update the buy-and-sell system of the Gilded Rose team,
by adding a new feature to the system.

The steps followed in order for this process to be implemented were,

1. To write Unit Tests for the already implemented system;
2. To refactor the UpdateQuality() method within the GildedRose Class without changing
anything within the Item Class;
3. To write Unit Tests for the new feature (Conjured Items);
4. To write the appropriate code for making the tests pass;
